## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
The content providing website has become a trend recently. The website will provide contents in forms of many media vectors like video, audio and passages. In a time of open-source while most resources are monopolized by giants, most of the content providing websites could not earn money from the user payment, thus the data gained from the users has become a rather more important part for them to survive. 

Thus as a team of 2 who not only participate as users but also might head into such an industry to earn for living, we are keen to fully make use of the provided user data. Movie is a good object to start with, as there is existing data to use and has a long history of development which potentially has a great scale of people giving comments and it will absolutely last for a long time in the future.

In this project, we build up a movie recommendation system using the knowledge and techniques learned in classes and self-learning. We firstly find data from open source, then extend the data by using crawlers and take the extra dimensions to build up the model and algorithm. At last, we have a reactJS based frontend together with flask-api back end, not only to perform the recommendation, but also in usage of continuously collecting the data from users.
